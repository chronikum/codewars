# [From-To-Step Sequence Generator](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56459c0df289d97bd7000083)

Write a function that generate the sequence of numbers which starts from the "From" number, then adds to each next term the "Step" number until the "To" number. For example:

```python
generator(10, 20, 10) = [10, 20] # "From" = 10, "Step" = 10, "To" = 20
generator(10, 20, 1) = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] 
generator(10, 20, 5) = [10, 15, 20]

```
```haskell
generator 10 20 10 = [10, 20] -- "From" = 10, "Step" = 10, "To" = 20
generator 10 20 1 = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] 
generator 10 20 5 = [10, 15, 20]

```
```ruby
generator(10, 20, 10) = [10, 20] # "From" = 10, "Step" = 10, "To" = 20
generator(10, 20, 1) = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] 
generator(10, 20, 5) = [10, 15, 20]

```
If next term is greater than "To", it can't be included into the output array:

```python
generator(10, 20, 7) = [10, 17]

```
```haskell
generator 10 20 7 = [10, 17]

```
```ruby
generator(10, 20, 7) = [10, 17]

```


If "From" bigger than "To", the output array should be written in reverse order:

```python
generator(20, 10, 2) = [20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10]

```
```haskell
generator 20 10 2 = [20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10]

```

```ruby
generator(20, 10, 2) = [20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10]

```


Don't forget about input data correctness:

```python
generator(20, 10, 0) = []
generator(10, 20, -5) = []
```
```haskell
generator 20 10 0 = []
generator 10 20 -5 = []
```
```ruby
generator(20, 10, 0) = []
generator(10, 20, -5) = []
```
"From" and "To" numbers are always integer, which can be negative or positive independently. "Step" can always be positive.
